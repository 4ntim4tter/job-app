<h1>Laravel Project Job posting site with authentication for admin and client accounts.</h1>

Public job posts to which anyone can apply. 
Client accounts are created by sending a request to the site which all admins can see and create.
When an admin account is created it has to be approved by the site owner by activating the account in the database.
Admins can see the company statistics and modify companies while clients can add new job posts and see applications.
The database is seeded with dummy data for testing purposes and is using SQlite.

The site needs a bit to load when running for the first time after idle time, please be patient and reload the site
after a minute or two.
